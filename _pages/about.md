I am a researcher in fluid mechanics, with a special interest in microfluidics, bio-flows and complex fluids, using simulation and analytical tools to investigate various problems. I have a PhD from the University of Edinburgh on the topic of blood cell microfluidics in periodic geometries.

I have expertise in the lattice Boltzmann method, immersed boundary method and discrete element method, and use `python`, `julia` and `c++` to build flow and transport simulators in 2D and 3D.

I am currently looking for new opportunities in aligned research, especially with experimental collaborations.
